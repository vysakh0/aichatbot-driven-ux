# AI Chatbot-Driven UX

A proof-of-concept project that demonstrates how AI-driven chat interfaces can enhance traditional web applications. This project implements a chatbot layer on top of a Todo list application to reduce user friction and streamline interactions.

## Overview

This project explores the intersection of conventional web UIs and conversational interfaces, using a Todo list application as a testing ground. The chatbot assists users in performing tasks with natural language commands, reducing the number of clicks and steps needed for common actions.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chat Interface**: Natural language processing for task management
- **Traditional Todo List UI**: Familiar interface with chatbot augmentation
- **Next.js Framework**: Built with modern React and Next.js
- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverages OpenAI's capabilities for natural language understanding

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React
- OpenAI API
- TypeScript
- Jotai (State Management)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vysakh0/aichatbot-driven-ux.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env.local` file.

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Future Plans

- Integration with OpenAI's real-time API for enhanced responsiveness
- Exploration of voice-based interactions
- Development of more sophisticated agentic UI patterns
- Expansion of natural language command capabilities

## Project Philosophy

This project serves as a stepping stone toward fully agentic UIs in SaaS applications. While traditional interfaces work well, adding a chat-driven layer can significantly reduce friction in user interactions. The goal is to explore how AI can enhance rather than replace existing UI patterns.
